# SunshineCoastMakerFaire2016

Thanks for taking the time to get scanned at the GetMakered 3D Selfie Trailer at Sunshine Coast Maker Faire 2016  in Gibsons! We apologize for the slight delay in getting your files back to you, we had a huge turn out and it took awhile to upload and organize all the files!
  
We had a blast and hope you did as well.  As promised, we're sending you a link to download your scanned image and some tips on getting it print-ready. 

 
We have NOT done any cleaned up the files or done any pre-processing, so you are getting the raw .STL files. 
 
As soon as we get some time, we'll take a look them all and print some of the best ones. In the meantime, you can get started on your own 3D printing adventure.  
 


<strong>Short Cut! Let Us Print it for you!</strong>
 
If you'd just like to get a printed version of your image, Owyn and Dustin, two of the GetMakered Crew will happily print them for you for a small fee to cover costs and you'll be helping to support our ongoing efforts to bring more 3D Adventures to the Coast. Just tell us the name of the person you want printed in the note.

<strong>Do It Yourself</strong>
 
However, with a just a little more work, you should be able to take this file to any Maker Space or 3D Printing Service and get it printed yourself. 

There are 4 steps to getting a good printed image: Scanning, Cleaning, Slicing, then Printing on a decent Printer.
 
We did the first step together at the Maker Faire with you and created the 3D Scanned image file (.STL).


<strong>(1) Download your Scanned Images (.STL file)!</strong>
 
The Scans we did of you were exported as .STL files and your 3D Selfie file can be found here:

The Scans are numbered and you should have recieved an email with your number. We do this to preserve the privacy of the individuals.
 
We used an Microsoft XBox 360 Kinect and Skanect software to do the scans and are pretty pleased with the results. For the most part, there are no huge 'holes' in the scans which would cause issues printing. Still, you may want to open the files up and do a bit of clean up before going to the slicing step.

 
<strong>(2) Cleaning up Your Scanned Image (.STL)!</strong>

Most of your files are near perfect and will not have any issues, but if you see extra floaty bits in your scan or a hole in your head, you might want to clean the image up a bit.
 
The software we use for cleaning up scans is called MeshLabs. You can download for free and available here:
   
http://sourceforge.net/projects/meshlab/files/latest/download
 
We usually try and delete any extraneous floating items that the scan technician might have accidentally added to your image. This is usually caused by an object (arm or hand) entering the scanner's range when doing the scan or someone coming into the scanning area even for a few seconds while the scan was in progress. It's quite easy to remove and it should be cleaned up prior to printing.

 
With MeshLab, you can also delete the scraggly bits of the bottom of the scan so that the printed bust will sit flat when printed. Use the "Select Faces in a rectangular region" icon on from the main navigation bar, select the bottom of the scan, then click on the "Delete the current set of selected faces' icon on the main navigation bar. This will delete and clean up the lower half of your image.
 
Be sure to save the cleaned up file with a new name (alexCleanedUp.stl for example) so that you do not overwrite your original one!

 
<strong>(3) Slicing your image (Generating a .G file) !</strong>

 
3D printing is all about layers: the printer lays down a thin layer of plastic or resin and slowly builds up the image. So you must prepare the slices and create a .g format file for the printer.

 
We did this using free software from Tinkerine called Tinkerine Suite which you can download here:

You can scale the images up or down. We usually print images that are just under 100 mm to get a sense of the quality of the images and so we don't use too much plastic. We also recommend doing a fill of 10% (the default) so that you create just enough internal support structures that the printed figure won't fall in on itself. With Tinkerine Suite, it's pretty easy to import, scale, slice and then save as a .g file.
 
Another super-useful slicing software is Cura from Ultimaker

<strong>(4) Get Printing!</strong>

 Each 3D printer has slightly different way of uploading the .G file. So read your manuals before you start printing to be sure you've selected the right parameters for your particular printer.  We highly recommend the Tinkerine Ditto Pro which you saw us printing with at the event. It's a rock-solid 3D printer that is great for both  beginners and pros! Not only that, but they are Vancouver-based and have great technical support too.


Once again, many thanks for taking the time to get scanned and learn about 3D technology with GetMakered!  If you could share a picture of your results with us on our Facebook page, we'd love to see your results!
