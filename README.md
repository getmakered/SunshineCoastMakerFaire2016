Thanks for taking the time to get scanned at the GetMakered 3D Selfie Trailer at Sunshine Coast Maker Faire 2016 in Gibsons!


Let Us Print it for you!

If you'd just like to get a printed version of your image, Owyn, one of the GetMakered Crew will happily print you for you for a small fee to cover costs and you'll be helping to support our ongoing efforts to bring more 3D Adventures to the Coast. Just tell us the name and number of the person you want printed in the note.

Do It Yourself!

However, with a just a little more work, you should be able to take this file to any Maker Space or 3D Printing Service to get it printed yourself.

(1) Download your Scanned Images

The Scans we did of you were exported as .STL files and your 3D Selfie file can be found here:

https://github.com/getmakered/SunshineCoastMakerFaire2016

The Scans are numbered and you should have received an email with your number. We do this to preserve the privacy of individuals.

(2) Cleaning up Your Scanned Image

First you will want to open up the file and possibly do a bit of cleaning before going to the slicing step.

Most of your files are near perfect and will not have any issues, but if you see extra floaty bits in your scan or a hole in your head, you might want to clean the image up a bit.

We usually try and delete any extraneous floating items that the scan technician might have accidentally added to your image. This is usually caused by an object entering the scanner's range. It's quite easy to remove and it should be cleaned up prior to printing.


Some tools that can be used for cleanup are:

3D Builder - Comes with Windows 10 and 8
Or
Tinkercad - www.tinkercad.com

(3) Get Printing!

Each 3D printer has slightly different way of uploading the .G file. So read your manuals before you start printing to be sure you've selected the right parameters for your particular printer. We highly recommend the Tinkerine Ditto Pro which you saw us printing with at the event. They are Vancouver-based and have great technical support too. - www.tinkerine.com

Once again, many thanks for taking the time to get scanned and learn about 3D technology with GetMakered! If you could share a picture of your results with us on our Facebook page, we'd love to see!
