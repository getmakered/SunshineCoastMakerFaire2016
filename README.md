Thanks for taking the time to get scanned at the GetMakered 3D Selfie Trailer at Sunshine Coast Maker Faire 2016 in Gibsons!

The Scans we did of you were exported as .STL files and can be found here:

Print It Yourself!

(1) Download Your Scan!

The Scans are numbered and you should have received an email with your number. We do this to preserve the privacy of individuals.

(2) Cleaning Up Your Scanned Image.

Most of your files are near perfect and will not have any issues, but if you see extra floaty bits in your scan or a hole in your head, you might want to clean the image up a bit.

We usually try and delete any floating items that the scan technician might have accidentally added to your image. It's quite easy to remove and it should be cleaned up prior to printing.

Some tools that can be used for cleanup are:

3D Builder - Comes with Windows 10 and 8
Or

(3) Get Printing!

Each 3D printer has slightly different way of uploading the .G file. So read your manuals before you start printing to be sure you've selected the right parameters for your particular printer. We highly recommend the Tinkerine Ditto Pro which you saw us printing with at the event. They are Vancouver-based and have great technical support too. - www.tinkerine.com

Many thanks for taking the time to get scanned and learn about 3D technology with GetMakered! If you could share a picture of your results with us on our Facebook page, we'd love to see!
